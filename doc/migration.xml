    <s3 title="Public API Changes">

        <p>&XercesCName; &XercesC3Version; is a major release and includes
           a number of application-breaking interface changes compared to
           &XercesCName; 2 series.
           The following sub-sections provide an overview of the public API
           changes between &XercesCName; 2 series and this release.</p>

        <s4 title="New Public APIs">
            <ul>
              <li>XMLGrammarPoolImpl implementation has been moved to
                  framework/ and is now publicly accessible</li>

              <li>DOM XPath interfaces now support XPath 2 model</li>

              <li>A number of DOM interfaces (DOMLSInput, DOMLSOuput,
                  DOMLSParser, DOMLSSerializer, DOMConfiguration, etc.)
                  were added as part of the the final DOM Level 3
                  specification conformance work</li>

        <anchor name="ModifiedAPI300"/>
        <s4 title="Modified Public APIs">

          <p>A large number of public APIs have been modified. Consult
             individual interface documentation for details. The following
             list gives an overview of major changes:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Several DOM interfaces have been adjusted to conform to the final
                DOM Level 3 specification</li>

            <li>DOM XPath interfaces have been adjusted to support both XPath 1
                and XPath 2</li>

            <li>Many public interfaces that used int/long types to represent
                memory-related sizes, counts, indexes, etc., have been modified
                to use the 64-bit safe XMLSize_t type instead</li>
          </ul>

        <anchor name="DeprecatedAPI300"/>
        <s4 title="Deprecated/Removed Public APIs">
          <p>All APIs marked as deprecated in &XercesCName; 2 series have
             been removed in this release. In particular deprecated DOM
             (depdom) as well as COM support have been removed.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, a number of DOM interfaces (DOMBuilder, DOMWriter,
             DOMInputSource, etc.) were replaced as part of the the final
             DOM Level 3 specification conformance work.</p>
