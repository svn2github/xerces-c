    <s2 title="PParse">
        <p>PParse demonstrates progressive parsing.</p>
        <p>In this example, the programmer doesn't have to depend upon throwing
            an exception to terminate the parsing operation. Calling parseFirst() will
            cause the DTD to be parsed (both internal and external subsets) and any
            pre-content, i.e. everything up to but not including the root element.
            Subsequent calls to parseNext() will cause one more piece of markup to
            be parsed, and spit out from the core scanning code to the parser. You
            can quit the parse any time by just not calling parseNext() anymore
            and breaking out of the loop. When you call parseNext() and the end
            of the root element is the next piece of markup, the parser will
            continue on to the end of the file and return false, to let you
			know that the parse is done.</p>

<source>Usage: PParse [options] &lt;file>

This sample program demonstrates the progressive parse capabilities of
the parser system. It allows you to do a scanFirst() call followed by
a loop which calls scanNext(). You can drop out when you've found what
ever it is you want. In our little test, our event handler looks for
16 new elements then sets a flag to indicate its found what it wants.
At that point, our progressive parse loop exits.

Options:
      -v=xxx        - Validation scheme [always | never | auto*]
      -n            - Enable namespace processing [default is off]
      -s            - Enable schema processing [default is off]
      -?            - Show this help (must be the only parameter)

  * = Default if not provided explicitly
</source>
          	<p>The output is the following:</p>
<source>cd &XercesCInstallDir;-linux/samples/data
PParse personal.xml

Got the required 16 elements.</source>
