    <s2 title="Building &XercesCName; on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++">
        <p>&XercesCName; source distribution comes with Microsoft Visual C++ projects and workspaces to
        help you build &XercesCName;. The following describes the steps you need
        to build &XercesCName;.</p>

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p>To build &XercesCName; from the source distribution (using MSVC), you will
            need to open the workspace containing the project. If you are
            building your application, you may want to add the &XercesCName;
            project inside your application's workspace.</p>
            <p>The workspace containing the &XercesCName; project file and
            all other samples is in:</p>
            <p>For MSVC Version 6:</p>
<source>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC6\xerces-all\xerces-all.dsw</source>
            <p>For MSVC Version 7.1 (Visual C++ .NET 2003):</p>
<source>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC7.1\xerces-all\xerces-all.sln</source>
            <p>For MSVC Version 8.0 (Visual C++ .NET 2005):</p>
<source>&XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC8\xerces-all\xerces-all.sln</source>

            <p>Once you are inside MSVC, you need to build the project marked
            <em>XercesLib</em>.</p>
            <p>If you want to include the &XercesCName; project separately,
            you need to pick up:</p>
<source>(For MSVC V6) &XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC6\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.dsp
(For MSVC V7.1) &XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC7.1\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.vcproj
(For MSVC V8) &XercesCSrcInstallDir;\Projects\Win32\VC8\xerces-all\XercesLib\XercesLib.vcproj</source>
            <p>You must make sure that you are linking your application with
            the &XercesCWindowsLib;.lib library and also make sure that
            the associated DLL is somewhere in your path.</p>
            <note>If you are working on the AlphaWorks version which uses ICU,
            you must have the ICU data DLL named <code>icudata.dll</code> available from your path
            setting. For finding out where you can
            get ICU from and build it, look at the <jump href="build-misc.html#faq-1">How to Build ICU</jump>.</note>

        </s3>
        <s3 title="Building samples">
            <p>If you are using the source package, inside the same workspace (xerces-all.dsw), you'll find several other
            projects. These are for the samples. Select all the samples and right click
            on the selection. Then choose "Build (selection only)" to build all the
            samples in one shot.</p>

            <p>If you are using the binary package, load the &XercesCInstallDir;-win32\samples\Projects\Win32\VC6\samples.dsw
              Microsoft Visual C++ workspace inside your MSVC IDE. Then select all the samples and right click
              on the selection. Then choose "Build (selection only)" to build all the
              samples in one shot.</p>

		<p>&XercesCName; may be built in the
		<jump href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</jump> environment for use
		by Cygwin applications.  As with the <jump href="#UNIX">UNIX</jump>
		platforms, &XercesCName; on Cygwin uses
		<jump href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</jump> tools.  Therefore, with a
		couple of notable exceptions, &XercesCName; on Cygwin is built using
		the same instructions as the UNIX platforms.</p>
	
		<p>Note that Cygwin is different from the UNIX platforms in the way
		that it finds libraries at run time.  While UNIX platforms may use the
		environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH, Cygwin uses the PATH environment
		variable.</p>

		<p>There is an issue with the
		<jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc/g++</jump>
		compiler version 2.95, where C++ exceptions thrown from a dll will
		cause the application to crash, regardless of whether there is a "catch"
		statement.  This bug doesn't occur in tests using gcc 3.1 or 3.2, so it
		is recommended that you use gcc 3.1 or higher.</p>
    </s2>

    <anchor name="UNIX"/>
    <s2 title="Building &XercesCName; on UNIX platforms">
        <p>&XercesCName; uses
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</jump> tools like
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">Autoconf</jump> and
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make</jump>
        to build the system. You must first make sure you
        have these tools installed on your system before proceeding.
        If you do not have required tools, ask your system administrator
        to get them for you. These tools are free under the GNU Public License
        and may be obtained from the
        <jump href="http://www.gnu.org">Free Software Foundation</jump>.</p>

        <p><em>Do not jump into the build directly before reading this.</em></p>

        <p>Spending some time reading the following instructions will save you a
        lot of wasted time and support-related e-mail communication.</p>

        <p>Besides having all necessary build tools, you also need to know what
        compilers we have tested &XercesCName; on. The following table lists the
        relevant platforms and compilers.</p>

     	&build-winunix-supported-platforms;

        <!-- note about building on untested platforms - see entities.ent -->
        &build-winunix-note;

        <p><em>Differences between the UNIX platforms:</em> The description below is
        generic, but as every programmer is aware, there are minor differences
        within the various UNIX flavors the world has been bestowed with.
        The one difference that you need to watch out in the discussion below,
        pertains to the system environment variable for finding libraries.
        On <em>Linux</em> and <em>Solaris</em>, the environment variable name is called
        <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, on <em>AIX</em> it is <code>LIBPATH</code>,
        on <em>Mac OS X</em> it is <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>,
        while on <em>HP-UX</em> it is <code>SHLIB_PATH</code>. The following
        discussion assumes you are working on Linux, but it is with subtle
        understanding that you know how to interpret it for the other UNIX flavors.</p>

        <note>If you wish to build &XercesCName; with ICU,
        look at the <jump href="build-misc.html#faq-1">Building &XercesCName; with ICU</jump>.
        It tells you where you can get ICU and how to build &XercesCName; with it.</note>

        <s3 title="Setting build environment variables">
            <p>Before doing the build, you must first set your environment variables
            to pick-up the compiler.
            While the first one is probably set for you by the system administrator, just
            make sure you can invoke the compiler. You may do so by typing the
            compiler invocation command without any parameters (e.g. xlc_r, or g++, or cc)
            and check if you get a proper response back.</p>
            </s3>

        <s3 title="Building &XercesCName; library">
            <p>As mentioned earlier, to build &XercesCName; from the source distribution,
            you must be ready with the GNU tools like
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</jump> and
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">gmake</jump>
            before you attempt the build.</p>

            <p>The autoconf tool is required on only one platform and produces
            a set of portable scripts (configure) that you can run on all
            other platforms without actually having the autoconf tool installed
            everywhere. In all probability the autoconf-generated script
            (called <code>configure</code>) is already in your <code>src/xercesc</code>
            directory. If not, type:</p>

<source>cd &lt;full path to &XercesCSrcInstallDir;&gt;
autoconf</source>

            <p>This generates a shell-script called <code>configure</code>. It is tempting to run
            this script directly as is normally the case, but wait a minute. 
			Even if you are using the default compilers like
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</jump> and
            <jump href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">g++</jump> 
            you need to make some decisions about what components you want to 
            build into the library.</p>

            <p>You need to specify one options from each category; not specifying one
			will instruct <code>configure</code> to pick the best choice available:</p>


	<p>Net Accessor (used to read data from HTTP sources):</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-curl</code> Uses curl</li>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-libwww</code> Uses W3C's libWWW</li>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-socket</code> Uses plain BSD sockets</li>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-cfurl</code> Uses cfurl (Mac-only)</li>
			<li><code>--enable-netaccessor-winsock</code> Uses WinSock (Windows-only, either Cygwin or MinGW)</li>
		</ol>
	<p>Message Loader (used to store the strings of the error messages):</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>--enable-msgloader-inmemory</code> Stores the messages in C++ arrays</li>
			<li><code>--enable-msgloader-icu</code> Stores the messages using ICU resource bundles</li>
			<li><code>--enable-msgloader-iconv</code> Stores the messages in a iconv message catalog</li>
		</ol>
	<p>Transcoder (used to convert strings between UTF-16 and any other supported encoding):</p>
		<ol>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-gnuiconv</code> Uses GNU iconv library</li>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-iconv</code> Uses iconv library</li>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-icu</code> Uses ICU library</li>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-macosunicodeconverter</code> Uses MacOS APIs (Mac-only)</li>
			<li><code>--enable-transcoder-windows</code> Uses Windows APIs (Windows-only, either Cygwin or MinGW)</li>
		</ol>

            <p>By default <code>configure</code> will build both shared and static libraries;
			you can use <code>--disable-shared</code> or <code>--disable-static</code> to
			suppress the version you don't need.</p>

            <p>Thread support is enabled by default too;
			you can use <code>--disable-threads</code> to remove it.</p>

            <p>If you need to specify a compiler (because more than one is found in the PATH,
			or because it has been renamed to a non-standard name), you should set the
			environment variables CXX and CC before invoking <code>configure</code>.<br/>
			If you need special compiler or linker options, define the environment variables
			CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS.</p>

            <note>&XercesCName; can be built as either a standalone library or as a library
            dependent on International Components for Unicode (ICU). For simplicity,
            the following discussion only explains standalone builds.</note>

            <anchor name="configure-example"/>
            <p>The simplest way to build &XercesCName; is as follows:</p>

<source>./configure</source>

            <p>This will instruct <code>configure</code> to find out the platform, the compiler
			and the libraries installed on the system. If more than one library is available
			for a category, the most powerful will be chosen (e.g. if ICU is available, it will
			be chosen over iconv).<br/>
			So it's recommended to examine the log to check if its choices are the correct ones.</p>
