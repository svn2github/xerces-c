            <p>Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the
            people involved in it. Mailing lists provide a simple and
            effective communication mechanism.   You are welcome to join
            any of these mailing lists (or all of them if you wish).
            You can choose to lurk, or actively participate. It's up to you.
            Before you join these lists, you should look over the resources
            in the Reference Library section</p>

            IBM also maintains a newsgroup for discussion of XML4C.  The
            news server is "news.alphaworks.ibm.com", and the group is
            "XML-for-C++".</p>

    <faq title="I found a defect - how do I report it?">
        <q>I found a defect - how do I report it?</q>
        <a>

            <p>Check the bug list at
            <jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/index.html">Apache</jump>.
            The problem may already be known, or even fixed.
           </p>

            <p>Otherwise, send the bugs to either the xerces-c-dev
            mailing list (preferred) or the IBM Alphaworks news group, as
            desribed above.  The more information that you can provide,
            the better the chance of understanding what happened, or
            what the problem really is.  Please include the version of Xerces-c or XML4C,
            what kind of machine, including Operating System and OS Verion Number,
            whether you built the xerces library yourself or used the binary distribution,
            the XML document (or excerpt) that fails, the C++ application code that failed,
            and what happened.

    <faq title="I have a patch to the Xerces C source code.  How do I submit it?">
        <q>I have a patch to the Xerces C source code.  How do I submit it?</q>
        <a>
            <p>Mail it to the xerces-c-dev mailing list at Apache  (You must be
               a subscriber to post to this list, but if you're considering changing
               the code you really want to be.)  There are no set
               rules about how or what must be included - if you've fixed a problem
               or enhanced the code in some way, we really would like to get the
               changes back and will take them in any reasonable form.</p>

            <p>Generally a diff of the changed files against the current sources
               from CVS is good, along with some kind of description of what the
               change is.  (Working with the current sources is important)</p>
