        <p>
        Schema is not supported in Xerces-C yet.  However work is in progress to port
        the Schema Support from Xerces-J to Xerces-C.
        </p>

        <p>
        We will first have a Schema Subset release in the summer, and then a full
        Schema PR (Proposed Recommendation) release in the fall.  The Schema Subset
        release will have the following minimal Schema support:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Partial Simple Type Support (Yes: atomic simple type. No:  union and list)</li>
            <li>Partial Complex Type Support (Yes: choice, sequence. No:   group, all)</li>
            <li>Element and Attribute Declaration (No: any/anyAttribute)</li>
            <li>Substitution groups</li>
            <li>Subset of pre-defined Datatypes:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Primitive datatypes: string, boolean, decimal, binary</li>
                <li>Derived datatypes: CDATA, integer</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Anything not mentioned above will be available in the Schema PR release later.
        </p>

        <p>
        Please note that the dates are tentative and subject to change.  There is a
        dependency on the Schema PR implementation in Xerces-J which is still under
        development, and a dependency on the status of Schema PR moving to Recommendation.
        </p>

        <p>
        If anyone would like to volunteer to help out with the schema port, that would
        be great.  Please post to <jump href="mailto:xerces-c-dev@xml.apache.org">
        Xerces-C-dev mailing list</jump>.
