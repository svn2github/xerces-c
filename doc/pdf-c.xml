	<p>You can get the entire &XercesCName; documentation in
	<jump href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/pdf/xerces-c++.pdf">PDF format</jump> for
	printing and offline reference.</p>
	<note>A word of caution! The tools to create the PDF documentation are still experimental.
	So the resulting PDF document is not perfect. We would be glad to receive your comments on
	<jump href="mailto:xerces-c-dev@xml.apache.org">&XercesCName; mailing list</jump>. We know,
	for example, that links do not work properly, images are not supported yet, and the
	shading within the document (around source code) does not print properly.</note>
