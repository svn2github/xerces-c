* change the string typecheck to only do an SvOK()
* does Xerces have any methods were a NULL XMLCh* value is needed? -
  if so we have to enable a %typemap to support it
* Xerces has some methods were a NULL pointer value is needed and some
  methods were it segfaults -  we have to enable a %typemap to
  differentiate between them
* %ignore and %rename behave differently when used with default
  arguments, ensure that the default args are included in the
  directives or it won't get used for all of them.
* make sure there are no memory leaks when exceptions are thrown -
  'goto fail' must work

* the %typecheck for XMLCh* is too greedy, it should happen later
  in the typecheck process
