* change the string typecheck to only do an SvOK()
* does Xerces have any methods were a NULL XMLCh* value is needed? -
  if so we have to enable a %typemap to support it
* Xerces has some methods were a NULL pointer value is needed and some
  methods were it segfaults -  we have to enable a %typemap to
  differentiate between them
* %ignore and %rename behave differently when used with default
  arguments, ensure that the default args are included in the
  directives or it won't get used for all of them.

* the %typecheck for XMLCh* is too greedy, it should happen later
  in the typecheck process

* make entity resolver to find all the xml files

* use %newobject and %typemape(newfree) for methods like removeNode()
* look into using SWIG_RegisterMapping() instead of inheritance hack
