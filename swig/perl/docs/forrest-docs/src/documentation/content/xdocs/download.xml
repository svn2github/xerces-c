<title>Downloading &PROJECT_NAME;</title>
  <section>
<title>Getting the source code</title>
    <p> The most current stable source code for &PROJECT_NAME; can be
    downloaded from <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-p/"> here </a>
    </p>
    <p> Previous releases are available from the <a
    href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-p/"> archives </a>
    </p>

  <section>
<title>Verifying the release</title>
    <p> The current &PROJECT_NAME; maintainer, Jason E. Stewart
      (<a
      href="mailto:jasons@apache.org">jasons@apache.org</a>), signs
      every release with his <a
      href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> public key. This is to
      help you ensure that you are installing only officially
      sanctioned code, from the official maintainer. By downloading
      the source code and signature from one location (<a
      href="http://www.apache.org/info/20010519-hack.html">possibly
      open to attack</a>) and the public key from an official key
      server, you greatly reduce the chance of installing software
      that is dangerous to you.
    </p>

    <section>
<title>Getting the Public key</title>
      <p> You can use any keyserver you wish, such as <a
      href="http://www.keyserver.net/">www.keyserver.net</a>, and
      search for <em>jasons@apache.org</em> or you can get the
      key<a
      href="http://dtype.org:11371/pks/lookup?search=jasons%40apache.org&amp;op=index">
      here </a>.
