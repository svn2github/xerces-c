<q>What application did you used to create the documentation?</q>

<a>
<p>We used an internal XML based application to create the
documentation. The documentation files are all written in XML and the
application, internally codenamed StyleBook, makes use of XSL to transform
it into an HTML document.</p>

<p>The API documentation was created using the Perl standard tool POD2HTML.</p>
