 * 3.2.5.1 Lexical representation
 *
 *   double values have a lexical representation consisting of a mantissa followed, 
 *   optionally, by the character "E" or "e", followed by an exponent. 
 *
 *   The exponent ·must· be an integer. 
 *   The mantissa must be a decimal number. 
 *   The representations for exponent and mantissa must follow the lexical rules 
 *   for integer and decimal. 
 *
 *   If the "E" or "e" and the following exponent are omitted, 
 *   an exponent value of 0 is assumed.
