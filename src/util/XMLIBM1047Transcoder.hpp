//  This class provides an implementation of the XMLTranscoder interface
//  for a simple ibm-1047 transcoder. The parser does some encodings
//  intrinsically without depending upon external transcoding services.
//  To make everything more orthagonal, we implement these internal
//  transcoders using the same transcoder abstraction as the pluggable
//  transcoding services do.
