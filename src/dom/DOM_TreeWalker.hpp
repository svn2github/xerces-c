     * TreeWalker objects are used to navigate a document tree or subtree using the view of
     * the document defined by its <code>whatToShow</code> flags and any filters that are defined for the
     * TreeWalker. Any function which performs navigation using a TreeWalker will
     * automatically support any view defined by a TreeWalker.
     *
     * Omitting nodes from the logical view of a subtree can result in a structure that is
     * substantially different from the same subtree in the complete, unfiltered document. Nodes
     * that are siblings in the TreeWalker view may be children of different, widely separated
     * nodes in the original view. For instance, consider a Filter that skips all nodes except for
     * Text nodes and the root node of a document. In the logical view that results, all text
     * nodes will be siblings and appear as direct children of the root node, no matter how
     * deeply nested the structure of the original document.
